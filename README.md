## Monskin Cosmetics

This project uses advancements in smartphone and web browser performance, enabling richer, more dynamic web experiences. Real-time 3D rendering enhances product showcases by providing a more immersive and intuitive understanding of the featured items. The goal of this project is to seamlessly blend the visual presentation with the physical characteristics of the product. The rippling form—symbolizing ease of application of the cosmetic product—is dynamically represented, flowing in real time to create an intuitive experience of the characteristics of the product. This concept can be expanded to the branding and storytelling of the brand.

- Compact cosmetic product was designed and 3D modeled with Rhino3D
- 3D model was imported and displayed with THREE.js
- Used sine functions to manipulate vertex positions of the 3D model mesh
